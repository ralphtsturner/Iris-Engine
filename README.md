# Iris-Engine
A simple SDL2 and C++ graphics engine i am currently working on thats very simple to use.

# Steps to install on linux and mac:
  - 1 Install bear via homebrew or apt-get with ubuntu/debian linux distros.
  - 2 Compile makefile using "bear -- make" to add clangd file support and compiler flags
  - 3 run bin/main with "./bin/main"

# Note:
  - If you are on a mac you might want to change the makefile to specify exact paths and library dirs for linking and compiling.
